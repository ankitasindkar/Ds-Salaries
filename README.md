Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished in this project:
1. Utilized Cards to display key metrics such as Total Count of id, sum of salary, year and experience level.
2. Introduced a visually appealing Donut chart to visualize Average salary in USD by employment type and remote ration by experience level, to  provide a quick overview of organizational structures.
3.Utilized Bar Chart to Display the average salary for each job role using a bar chart. This will allow stakeholders to quickly compare salary levels across different roles.
4.Developed Line Charts to track salary trends over a year for different job roles.

Grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills in data visualization, analytics, and storytelling, this project has been an enriching experience.
